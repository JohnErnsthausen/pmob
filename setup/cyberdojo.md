<h1>What to expect: cyber-dojo</h1>

<div>
  <h2>cyber-dojo</h2>
  <p>cyber-dojo is a place to practice programming<!-- <img src="/assets/images/setup/..." class="setupImg"/> --></p>

  <h2>How does cyber-dojo work?</h2>
  <p>cyber-dojo is a web based development environment.  It is hosted on a linux cloud machine. Your pub host provides you a URL to access cyber-dojo. It's a simple WYSIWYG editor you already know how to use.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>How do I get ready?</h2>
  <p>You don't have much to do.  You'll need a decent internet connection (20 Mbps up and down) and a modern browser. Your host will provide the URL the day of your session.  If you can run zoom, cyber-dojo should have all it needs.</p> 

  <h2><a id="fallback-rule"></a>What about when it's my turn?</h2><!-- TODO anchor tag here -->
  <p>Participants sharing the cyber-dojo development environment simply refresh their browser, once the page reloads you are synced with the last test run. </p>

  <h2>Tradeoffs for cyber-dojo</h2>
  <p>Benefits:</p>
  <ul class="list outer">
    <li><p>Virtually no setup or installation required.</p></li>
    <li><p>Rapid handovers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Puts the burden on the host to worry about build, test, and configuration issues.</p></li>
    <li><p>The experience looks the same to everyone for the entire session.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Costs:</p>
  <ul class="list outer">
    <li><p>Minimalist editor with few creature comforts.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>cyber-dojo is ideal for the short sessions that PubMob offers, putting all the burden for session preparation on your {{ site.sesson-lead-term }}. It's also great for work in languages such as C or C++, where getting everyone to build the software on their machine might be asking too much. You might be giving up your comfortable development environment for a short while, but you'll be hands-on immediately with minimal worries.</p>
