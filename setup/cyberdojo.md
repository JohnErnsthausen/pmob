<h1>What to expect: Cyber Dojo</h1>

<div>
  <h2>Cyber Dojo</h2>
  <p>blah blah <!-- <img src="/assets/images/setup/..." class="setupImg"/> --></p>

  <h2>How does Cyber Dojo work?</h2>
  <p>blah blah</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>How do I get ready?</h2>
  <p>blah blah</p> 

  <h2><a id="fallback-rule"></a>One-chance setup / fallback rule</h2><!-- TODO anchor tag here -->
  <p>The first time you drive, you'll be asked to ... . Occasionally there are XXX issues ... . If at first you're unsuccessful, your {{ site.session-lead-term }} will attempt to help you resolve the problem. If you're unsuccessful, you'll be asked to type onto the {{ site.session-lead-term }}'s machine using Zoom's remote control capability for the remainder of the session.</p>

  <h2>Tradeoffs for Cyber Dojo</h2>
  <p>Benefits:</p>
  <ul class="list outer">
    <li><p>Virtually no setup or installation required</p></li>
    <li><p>Rapid handovers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Puts the burden on the host to worry about build, test, and configuration issues.</p></li>
    <li><p>The experience looks the same to everyone for the entire session.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Costs:</p>
  <ul class="list outer">
    <li><p>Spotty internet connection ???.</p></li>
    <li><p>Minimalist editor with few creature comforts</p></li>
    <li><p>???</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cyber Dojo is ideal for the short sessions that PubMob offers, putting all the burden for session preparation on your {{ site.sesson-lead-term }}. It's also great for work in languages such as C or C++, where getting everyone to build the software on their machine might be asking too much. You might be giving up your comfortable development environment for a short while, but you'll be hands-on immediately with minimal worries.</p>
