# Statement on PubMob and the pub motif

Wondering about the pub motif? Read the following personal statement from Jeff Langr about PubMob's origins, the associated pub motif, and the relationship with alcohol.

PubMob.com has a clear [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct). We do not tolerate abusive conduct from anyone. That includes those under the influence of alcohol.

## PubMob origins

I've provided consulting independently since 2003. During that time, I've also managed to work in at least 5 years worth of building software (and coaching others to do so) remotely: One year at GeoLearning (defunct), three years at Outpace, and at least a year working remotely with developers at various customers (including Ford and Sonic). Last fall I knew this the direction I wanted to take my personal consultancy, and began taking steps toward that.

After COVID-19 forced businesses to shutter their offices, millions of software developers suddenly found themselves working from home.

Shortly after, I started a weekly public mobbing session for a few reasons:

* {: .outer} Have something to do on Fridays

* {: .outer} Increase my social interaction during the shutdown, and stave off feelings of isolation

* {: .outer} Continue exploring mechanisms for building software remotely and collaboratively

* {: .outer} See if we could build useful software to improve upon the fairly sad state of collaborative development tooling
{: .list}

Since I was promoting these free sessions through my Twitter account (@jlangr), I derived the hashtag #PubMob as a portmanteau of **pub**lic and **mob**bing. (Of note, the word *pub* comes from the term *public house*.)

The first #PubMob session was held Tuesday April 10. We shifted to Fridays and have held sessions every week since. #PubMob has been successful in keeping at least a handful of folks entertained, engaged, and learning each week. Over 20 people receive the regular invitation.

A few weeks after initiating #PubMob, still in COVID-19 lockdown, I was frustrated with how to take my consultancy to the next step in offering remote services--hopefully through finding a significant customer. I'd also had considerable recent success with introducing remote mobbing to two of my customers.

My wife told me to take the dog for a walk--her way of saying, "get out of the house and clear your head." This head-clearing helped me see that remote, public mobbing sessions were staring me in the face as a path forward. 

As a result, I started PubMob.com as a way to:

* {: .outer} Create a marketplace for independent experts / trainers to offer their skills, and also provide them a way to demonstrate their skills to people in a low-cost way--"try before you buy."

* {: .outer} Democratize direct access to such experts, by offering short hands-on sessions with a small number of attendees

* {: .outer} Help the world find a better way to do remote development in a humane and fun manner

* {: .outer} Provide a way for those impacted by the new isolation to stay home, stay safe, and stay human 
{: .list}

Remote software development is here to stay, and many people will remain working remotely from now through the end of their career. PubMob.com is one answer to the question, "How do we make it work?"

## Alcohol

Alcohol continues to be a legal but dangerous drug in most parts of the world. According to one study, around [6% of Americans have a drinking disorder](https://www.verywellmind.com/prevalence-of-alcoholism-in-the-united-states-67876).

I've known three severe alcoholics well during my adulthood. Two died, one definitively from excessive drinking, the second died two days ago (from when I wrote this) with alcohol certainly a significant factor in her demise. The other managed to find her way out of the destruction it had caused... for now.

All of this to say: I find alcohol abuse sad. But I also recognize that drinking alcohol is extremely popular worldwide, and that most people are capable of being responsible with respect to alcohol. I neither condone nor celebrate its use.

## PubMob and alcohol

The pub motif for PubMob.com exists mostly to get you to think about a public house in its most social sense: As a gathering place for strangers, strange friends, families, and team members to get together, relax, and enjoy something together--maybe even make a life-long connection. My experience in pubs isn't heavy, but I've always appreciated their warmth and friendliness, whether it's a brewery in Colorado or a small-town pub in Ireland. For those not susceptible to alcohol abuse, a brewery or pub can be a healthy place for social interaction.

You may have been personally impacted by abuse of alcohol. I fully understand if that creates some distaste for the motif.

**We do not discuss alcohol during PubMob.com sessions on software development.** You will not see alcohol advertised or promoted on the site. (You *will* see photos of pubs and people within, and you'll see glasses and bottles that might contain alcohol.) But the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) for PubMob.com session attendees is clear: **We don't tolerate jerks, and that includes people whose use of alcohol leads to any conduct-violating actions or statements.** They get booted.

If it helps, please remember that PubMob is short for *Public Mobbing*.
