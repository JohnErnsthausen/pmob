# Code of conduct

PubMob sessions are lively, interactive events. Our goal is to allow you to learn and engage in a fun but safe manner.

Your admission to a PubMob.com session is dependent upon you accepting the terms & conditions, which includes adherence to the code of conduct.

PubMob is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all attendees, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or personal belief system. Verbal or physical harassment or intimidation of any kind, including unwelcome sexual attention, will not be tolerated. Sharing threatening or sexual imagery will also not be tolerated.

If asked to stop any behavior deemed as harassment, you are expected to immediately comply. You will be ejected immediately for egregious violations.

If you violate the harassment policy will be disconnected from the PubMob session, without a refund.

PubMob sessions are recorded. If ejected, you may request a review of the incident.

If you feel you are being harassed during a PubMob session, notify the PubMob representative running your session, or contact info @ langrsoft.com.

Please keep the politics and anger at home, and have fun. PubMob is a forum for learning and doing software development. It is not a forum for venting your political beliefs, no matter how righteous you may feel about them.

PubMob works best when all participants seek to help and boost each other. Please keep this in mind.

And despite the pub theme, please don't get inebriated while attending a session--it won't excuse you from getting ejected for violating this code of conduct.

For questions or concerns regarding the PubMob code of contact policy, please contact info @ langrsoft.com.
