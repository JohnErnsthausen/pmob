Are you struggling with implementing effective test automation?  Are you just getting started and want to avoid the common obstacles that prevent many from succeeding?  We’ll work through assessment activities over a one to two hour conversation that will provide you with a clear understanding of where you are and what you need to do to move forward with effective test automation.

I’ll help you get ready to succeed with test automation via the following activities:

* We’ll work through a readiness assessment checklist to identify obstacles to effective test automation.  Areas of focus include development and testing practices, test environment and data management and skill sets & technology

* We’ll develop a three-phased implementation plan for addressing any obstacles and building effective test automation into your delivery cycle
