In call your shot TDD, any time you press the test button, you should have an expectation of outcome of your test-run: failing test (red), passing test (green), or broken build (yellow).  Success in development means that everything is working as expected. In this mob we practice small steps and try to avoid unanticipated outcomes.  We'll call each shot.

We'll work on a programming kata hosted on cyber-dojo. No tools need to be installed on your local machine. No git repos need to be cloned. All you need is a modern browser.
