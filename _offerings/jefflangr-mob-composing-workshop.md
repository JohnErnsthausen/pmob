Suppose you have a software development team of five folks challenged with delivering five features. That team working as a mob--focusing on only one feature at a time--can actually deliver all five features faster than those same five folks trying to "divide & conquer" the features.

What does a mob look like, though, and why might working this way actually speed things up? If you're not a technical person, watching a development team mobbing might not help you understand either the mechanics or the reasons behind its success.

If you *are* a technical person, don't necessarily skip past this session, which will allow you to experience mobbing without the distraction of a coding problem--it's easy for some of us get too deeply mired in problem solving. The session might also open your eyes to the possibility of using mobbing outside the software world. Plus, you haven't really mobbed until you've composed music in a small group.

What does a mob *feel* like?

Without experiencing mobbing firsthand, you'd likely think that mobbing is a chaotic and dangerous practice based on the name alone. Done well, it is not: Your teams can keep their mob sessions focused, enjoyable, and productive by employing a few simple rules. They'll play together like a well-seasoned orchestra.

In this hands-on workshop, you'll mob to collaboratively compose a short song (movie theme? jingle? theme song?). Even if you know little about music, you'll feel how mobbing can reduce your anxiety and help you contribute to the team in short order. You'll learn mobbing by doing, through a series of "mob pomodoros," each introducing new mob tips and composing wisdom. You’ll experience first-hand the value proposition of mob programming. Finally, you'll also help contribute to thoughts about why mobbing can speed us up.

Note: We need only one machine per mob. However, if there are enough attendees, we'll run multiple mobs, in which case it'll help to have a few computers on hand ready to support the session. You can prepare for the session by following the instructions at http://github.com/jlangr/geektone to download and install the software that we'll use. Specifically, you'll need Node.js installed (to run the app locally) and a web browser other than Internet Explorer (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge should all work).
