During this session, we'll briefly touch on some key themes that will help keep you safe when touching legacy code. We'll then work through some of the legacy-breaking techniques that will enable you to start getting a handle on your object-oriented legacy code. You'll learn about as many of these dependency breaking techniques as we can fit:

* Expose static method
* Extract and override call
* Parameterize constructor
* Break out method object
* Template redefinition (C++)

Most of these legacy code PubMob sessions are run in Java, which has become our lingua franca, but I'm sure you have legacy code in whatever other language you code in. Don't hesitate to ping me if you're interested in a private legacy code session or two on your own codebase, whether it be C++, Kotlin, or C#.
