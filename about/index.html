    <p class="p first">PubMob is a marketplace for remote training, coaching, and development, with a strong social emphasis. On PubMob, you can meet in a virtual pub full of happy people&mdash;friendly strangers, strange friends, or teammates&mdash;to learn and build software together. You'll learn from experts at a reasonable price, while you stay home, stay safe, and stay human.</p>
    <p class="p first">After most of us find ourselves physically isolated from others, we wanted to help bring back some of that lost social interaction. Through trial &amp; error gained from years of remote experience, we honed a highly enjoyable and effective way to develop software remotely. We want to share that experience. Our goal is for PubMob to provide a forum for fun, ad hoc learning and work.</p>
