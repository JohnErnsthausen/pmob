- still a few mountain photos
- calendar links actual
- heading inconsistency front page, also margins
- lookup (e.g. given an ID get supporting data)
- master list of technologies?
- filter fix
- styling / colors
- fix header / logo stuff properly, not a hack (right now it is a max-width image)
- stupid mini menu overwrites top part of page
- consistent technologies / topics list
- styling with |
- hover help on tech buttons
- category filters
    - by topic
    - by programming language
    - put into legend section
- languages on pub page (icons)
- flesh out Jeff's page with bar image, etc.
- smaller font on tech on pub page
- page headers consistent text font
- layout of bottom
- larger logo
- Christine new brain icon
- statements on alcohol. "public mob"
- accordion for filters?
- code of conduct
