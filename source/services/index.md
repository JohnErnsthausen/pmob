  You and your team must deliver. Now, continually, and with quality. You want a team that
  can hit the ground running and ship software without a whole lot of supervision.
  </p>
  <p>
  We deliver software, and we deliver capability--the capability for your teams to increase
  their productivity while also increasing their ability to ship quality software. Let us
  work with you and help build software and teams that know what it takes to succeed,
  distributed or not, by applying modern quality and team practices.

      as a team.

      You need to continually and consistently deliver value. The beauty of building software
      is that you can develop despite the many obstacles dropped in your path,
      by adopting a core approach that keeps your teams productive, cohesive, healthy, and happy.

    <p>
      You have software to deliver. From years of experience, you know that cutting corners
      on quality doesn't really speed you up. Instead, work with software developers who
      know how to build quality software while sustaining a solid delivery pace over time.

  We can deliver all services to you on-site, remotely,
  or with some combination of working remote and on-site.
  </p>
  <p>
  You want your team members to have the best opportunity to improve based on our presence
  (whether physical or virtual). For an optimal engagement, we heavily focus on collaborative
  development technicques, including mobbing (mob programming) and pairing. We also use dojos
  for engagements that involve a combination of training and the need to deliver real work.
  </p>
  <p>
  For more about mobbing and why we prefer it, read
