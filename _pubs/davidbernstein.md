I’m David Bernstein of To Be Agile.

I help software development teams improve their development process and master technical practices to rapidly deliver quality software. Using a combination of training and consultation, I'll show you how to master practices such as test-driven development, refactoring, and continuous delivery.

I'll help you:

Define: I’ll help you define what to build along with acceptance tests that tell you when you’ve built it. Working with your Product Owner and backlog, we’ll define stories and work through examples so you know exactly what to build. You’ll streamline how you define what’s to be built and turn development into a discovery process.

Educate: I'll help your team master the technical practices of Agile software development quickly so they are productive with these techniques immediately. I’ll expose your team to best practices and systems that will hugely improve the quality and efficiency of their work.

Integrate: I'll help you improve your build and verification process for the software you deliver so it becomes a rich source of information to improve development. Defects will be caught faster and the costs associated with finding them will drops significantly.

Advise: Through code inspections, design reviews, and mini-assessments, I’ll advise you on best uses of your efforts. Working with your developers on their code, we’ll identify areas of risk and where to focus attention to get the most value.
